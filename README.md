# DSA Questions & Concepts

This repository contains important Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) concepts, each organized in its own folder. Every concept folder includes a `problemStatements.md` file listing relevant problems, solutions, and hints.

## Structure

```
cpp_Codes/
│
├── LCS/
│   └── problemStatements.md
├── DP/
│   └── problemStatements.md
├── Trees/
│   └── problemStatements.md
├── Graphs/
│   └── problemStatements.md
├── ... (other concepts)
└── README.md
```

## How to Use

- Browse each concept folder for curated problems and hints.
- Refer to `problemStatements.md` in each folder for explanations and solution approaches.
- Practice implementing solutions in the respective folders.

## Example: LCS (Longest Common Subsequence)

See [`LCS/problemStatements.md`](./LCS/problemStatements.md) for:
- Longest Common Subsequence
- Longest Common Substring
- Print All LCS
- Shortest Common Supersequence
- Print Shortest Common Supersequence
- Minimum Insertions and Deletions
- Longest Palindromic Subsequence
- Minimum Deletions for Palindrome

Each problem includes a description, hints, and solution strategies.
